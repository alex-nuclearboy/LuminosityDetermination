# Luminosity Determination

In order to determine the luminosity dependence on the excess energy Q, we used the quasi-elastic proton–proton scattering process.
In the proton–deuteron collisions, the protons from the beam scatter on the protons in the deuteron target and the neutrons from the deuteron play a role of spectators.

## Selection criteria for quasi-free proton-proton reaction studies

In the analysis quasi-elastically scattered protons were searched for with the primary events selection condition of exactly one charged particle in the Forward Detector and one charged particle in the Central Detector. 
Then, the dominating background processes were subtracted. 
The events corresponding to the charged pions registered in the CD were subtracted based on energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter (SEC) and thin plastic scintillator (PSB). 
A part of the background from elastic pd -> pd scattering corresponding to deuterons was subtracted applying the criterium for polar angle in CD (40,100)[deg], while part corresponding to protons was eliminated by fitting the polar angle in CD distribution for each interval of excess energy Q and polar angle in FD with the sum of two Gaussian functions.

In the calculations the prescaling factor of the applied experimental trigger #21 equal to 4000, as well as shadowing effect equals 4.5% were taken into account.

## Software

### ROOT 
ROOT is an object-oriented framework for large scale data analyses based on C++.
It was developed for experiments at CERN, in which an impressive amount of data has to be processed. It was originally designed for particle physics data analysis.
ROOT has an extensive library with modules in physics, mathematics, statistics, histograms and graphics. It contains statistics tools, which can be used for data analysis.
